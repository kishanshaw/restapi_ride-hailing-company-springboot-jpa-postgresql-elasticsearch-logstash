# restapi_ride-hailing-company-springboot-jpa-postgresql-elasticsearch-logstash
I have created a fully working REST API application for a ride-hailing company (say X). 
This application has the complete CRUD abilities. Any authorised person from X can hit the REST API to save the daily ride data like the booking id, the source location id, source location in terms of latitude and longitude, similar data for Destination also etc, and other attribute data.  I have used Spring boot, JPA and PostgreSQL and Maven to accomplish this project.   I have also integrated Elasticsearch and Logstash to enhance the searching capabilities of the application.  This allows to efficiently perform analytical operations on the ride data. This can help to reduce the daily cab cancellations by studying the daily data. This analysis, we can perform on Elasticsearch using its tremendously powerful  and effective search functionalities that are available. On the other hand, I have used Logstash to index and sync data from application database to Elasticsearch.
